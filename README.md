# Dragon Boat Seat Assignment App
This app is a tool to help dragon boat racing teams manage different seat assignments of their paddlers. 

## Work still in progress!
[See a live demo here of the current project](https://tender-volhard-482d71.netlify.app/)

## Build your roster
Create a paddler by inputting the person's name, gender, and weight. 

## Load paddlers into your boat
Select paddlers from your roster to place in a seat on the dragon boat. 

## Save seating assignments
Once you have your boat of paddlers configured the way you want, you can save it. You can create as many different seating assignments as you like, as well as
re-configure them if they need tweaking. 

## Visual Indicators of Weight Distribution
The area that the dragon boat resides in changes in color based on the weight distribution of the boat. This effect was achieved using a linear gradient, which 
changes in direction and opacity based on the weights of the paddlers in the boat. The gradient will be more intense in areas where the boat is comparatively heavier.
